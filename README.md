# TRC JavaScript (Angular) Libraries

**Note:** At the time of writing, [citeproc-js][] does not have a **package.json** file and therefore cannot be listed as an NPM dependency. Be sure you have citeproc-js ^1.1.122 available if using from a NPM-based dependency management solution. Bower does not have this problem.
